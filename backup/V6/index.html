        <h2><strong>A short position</strong></h2>
        <p>
            I study why technically competent and economically justified projects often struggle to achieve durable public acceptance, and what this reveals about how projects are governed.
            My work focuses on infrastructure and public service projects, where delivery performance, legitimacy, and long-term public value are tightly connected.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>My research agenda</strong></h2>
        <p>
            I approach projects as temporary governance arrangements rather than neutral delivery tasks.
            From this perspective, contracts, risk allocation, performance criteria, stakeholder engagement, and digital tools are mechanisms through which incentives are shaped, accountability is exercised, and legitimacy is negotiated over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Much of my work examines public–private partnerships and other long-term contracting models, with attention to how early governance choices influence behaviour, adaptability, and trust.
            Building on this, I study social licence for infrastructure and social sustainability, focusing on how projects gain, maintain, or lose acceptance across their life cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            More recently, my research has extended to digitalisation and artificial intelligence in project environments.
            Rather than assuming technological improvement, this work examines project-level readiness and the institutional limits of technology-led change.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Research briefs</strong></h2>
        <p>
            I write short research briefs to translate ideas into practical discussion.
            These are written for industry practitioners, policy audiences, and project professionals.
            More briefs will be added over time.
