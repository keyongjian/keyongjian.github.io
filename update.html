      <h2>Updates</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the Updates page. This page is dedicated to recording the latest developments on the website as well as important events and news in my career. Here, you will find announcements about new research projects, publications, and significant milestones. Stay tuned for regular updates as I continue to share my academic journey and professional achievements.</p>
      <h3>17 December 2024 - 2024 Annual Review</h3>
      <p>Over the past year, I have made significant contributions to research and publication, including one book, three book chapters, 12 journal papers, and one conference paper. It is important to note that publications accepted but not yet published are not included in these figures. I was also honoured to receive the Merit Paper Award at the 29th CRIOCM 2024 in Xiâ€™an, China. I look forward to continuing this momentum and building further collaborations in the year ahead.</p>
      <h3>20 September 2024 - World's Top 2% Scientists</h3>
      <p>I am honoured to be again listed in Stanford University's "World's Top 2% Scientists" for both the single year and career-long impact in the field of building and construction. This recognition reflects the collaborative efforts and contributions of my colleagues, co-authors, and students. I am grateful for the support from my academic and professional network and will continue to contribute to advancing knowledge and practice in project management and infrastructure development. Thank you to everyone who has been part of this journey!</p>
      <h3>15 September 2024 - Four New Papers</h3>
      <p>I have recently updated my website to include four new publications that are currently in press. These additions highlight ongoing research contributions in various areas of project management and construction. The newly added papers cover a dynamic framework for evaluating highway maintenance performance using grey theory, an analysis of design error causation from a multi-stakeholder perspective in the construction industry, a model for assessing the suitability of public-private partnerships in urban China, and a study on the impact of job satisfaction on turnover intentions among construction professionals in China. Full texts of these publications are now available for download on my website <a href="publication.html">here</a>.</p>
      <h3>19 August 2024 - Another New Paper</h3>
      <p>A new paper titled "Impact of Psychological Distance on Public Acceptance of Waste-to-Energy Combustion Projects" has been published in Environmental Impact Assessment Review. This study explores how psychological distance influences public perception and acceptance of waste-to-energy facilities, offering insights for sustainable development and governance. You can read the full paper <a href="publication.html">here</a>.</p>
      <h3>5 August 2024 - A New Grant and A New Paper</h3>
      <P>I am thrilled to share the latest updates on my research. My new paper, "Exploring the Effect of Procedural Fairness on the Social License to Operate of Resource Development Projects: A Meta-Analysis," has been published in the journal Resources Policy. This study examines how procedural fairness influences the social license to operate in resource development projects, providing critical insights into stakeholder engagement and project sustainability. In addition, I am excited to announce a collaborative research project with Abu Dhabi University, which aims to measure social license for infrastructure. This joint effort seeks to develop frameworks for assessing and enhancing community acceptance of infrastructure projects, contributing to more sustainable and socially responsible development practices.</P>
      <h3>13 June 2024 - 2024 Journal Papers Available</h3>
      <p>I'm excited to announce that the <a href="publication.html">Selected Publications</a> page has been enriched with new content. All 2024 journal papers now have their full texts available for download. I will be adding the full texts of journal papers from other years soon. This effort is part of my commitment to making my research more accessible and highlighting significant contributions to the field. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to provide as many papers as possible. For a comprehensive list of all my publications, please refer to my <a href="files/CV.pdf">Full CV</a>.</p>
      <h3>6 June 2024 - Website Expansion</h3>
      <p>I have been using this website for a while, which previously only provided a landing page with a brief overview of myself and a few links to my CV and other online profiles. Today, I decided to invest time in further enriching the website by creating three additional pages: a "Research Interests" page, a "Selected Publications" page, and an "Updates" page. Additionally, I have added a new domain name, <a href="https://pm-professor.com">pm-professor.com</a>, to enhance accessibility.</p>
      <p>Maintaining a personal website is crucial for several reasons. Unlike a UTS profile, ORCiD, or other academic platforms, a personal website allows me to fully control the content and presentation, providing a comprehensive and cohesive representation of my professional identity. It serves as a central hub for showcasing my research, publications, and professional achievements, all in one place. It also provides a platform for sharing updates and important news, ensuring that colleagues, students, and industry professionals can stay informed about my work. Additionally, a well-maintained website enhances my online presence and facilitates networking opportunities. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to develop and expand the content on <a href="https://pm-professor.com">pm-professor.com</a>.</p>
