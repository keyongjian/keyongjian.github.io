        <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>My research spans a range of challenges in the delivery of infrastructure projects, including risk allocation, contracting behaviours, social acceptance and social sustainability, among others. I am particularly interested in sustainable infrastructure development and public-private partnerships (PPP) and their potential to drive new investment and collaboration opportunities between Australia and China.</p>
            <p>My current work includes two National Science Foundation of China-funded projects, one to develop a social license for infrastructure framework for Chinese contexts, and the other to investigate value co-creation in infrastructure projects. I also look at social sustainability within PPP projects and the use of procurement to create social value within and beyond the initial project aims.</p>
            <p>Previously, I have produced highly regarded research into the cultural and contractual differences between infrastructure teams in Australia and China and the use of social media to measure community sentiment towards infrastructure project delivery and Chinese investment in Australia. I have received funding from a range of academic and industry organisations, including the Australia-China Relations Institute, the Project Governance Control Symposium and the Project Management Institute.</p>
            <p>I am a Department Editor for the Project Management Journal, a Guest Professor at Chang&prime;an University in China and a Research Associate at the Australia-China Relations Institute. I hold a PhD in Management Science and Engineering and a Bachelor of Engineering from Tsinghua University in China.</p>
            <p>I teach in the postgraduate Project Management program. I am a champion of practice-oriented and research-integrated learning that emphasises the use of team-based simulated projects to solve real-world industry problems.</p>
            <p>I am a committed supervisor with interest in working with students from construction project management backgrounds. I have successfully supervised one PhD student who, during her PhD study, published five journal papers, had another three journal papers under review and won the 2020 Research with Most Potential Award at the 7th Infrastructure Research and Innovation Competition in China. I am also co-supervising another PhD student, and have previously co-supervised two students to completion.</p>
