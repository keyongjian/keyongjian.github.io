      <h2>G'day!</h2>
      <p>
        I am an Associate Professor in Project Management at the School of Built Environment, University of Technology Sydney, Australia. My name is pronounced "yong-jyen kuh".
      </p>

      <h2>A position</h2>
      <p>
        I study why technically competent and economically justified projects still face resistance, delay, and loss of trust, and what this reveals about how projects are governed.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, project delivery is not only technical execution. It is a social and institutional process. Contracts, procurement rules, performance measures, and engagement practices shape behaviour. They also shape legitimacy, credibility, and public value over time.
      </p>

      <h2>My research agenda</h2>
      <p>
        My research frames projects as temporary governance arrangements rather than neutral delivery vehicles. This means I focus on design choices made early, because they often lock in incentives, accountability, and stakeholder relationships that later become hard to change.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work across Australian and Chinese contexts. I use this comparative lens to make governance assumptions visible, and to test whether common project management ideas travel well across institutions.
      </p>

      <h2>What I am known for</h2>
      <p>
        A large part of my work centres on public private partnerships and long-term delivery models. I examine risk allocation and contracting behaviour, including how performance-based settings influence decision-making, adaptability, and long-term outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also focus on legitimacy and social outcomes in infrastructure delivery. I treat social licence and social sustainability as project conditions that can be built, damaged, and rebuilt, rather than a one-off communication task.
      </p>
      <p>
        More recently, I have extended this thinking to digitalisation and AI in project settings. I am interested in project-level readiness, governance guardrails, and what changes when decisions are supported by data-driven tools.
      </p>

      <h2>Research briefs</h2>
      <p>
        I write short research briefs to translate ideas into practical discussion. This section will grow over time.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/posts/1.html">Social licence and public acceptance in infrastructure projects</a><br />
          What social licence means in infrastructure, why it goes beyond consultation, and how acceptance changes across the life cycle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/posts/3.html">Risk allocation and management in public private partnerships</a><br />
          Why risk allocation is not just a clause, and how incentives and accountability shape delivery behaviour.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/posts/2.html">Advancing social sustainability in aged care</a><br />
          A practical view of social sustainability in aged care, with attention to service access, workforce conditions, and lived experience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Credibility, without the noise</h2>
      <p>
        I publish in leading journals in project management and the built environment. I have authored over 100 journal papers, with more than 7,900 citations and an h-index of 36. I have been recognised among the Stanford-listed Top 2% Scientist.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also contribute through editorial and community roles. My aim is to shape how the field thinks about governance, legitimacy, and long-term value in project delivery.
      </p>

      <h2>Working with me</h2>
      <p>
        I welcome research collaboration and doctoral supervision aligned with infrastructure delivery, governance, public private partnerships, social licence, social outcomes, and responsible use of digital and AI tools in project settings.
