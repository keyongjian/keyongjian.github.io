      <h2>G'day!</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my personal website. I'm Yongjian Ke, an Associate Professor of Project Management at the University of Technology Sydney, which is why the domain name is "<a href="https://pm-professor.com">pm-professor.com</a>". I'm part of the vibrant community at the School of Built Environment. If you're curious about the pronunciation of my name, a handy audio guide is available below.</p>

      <h3>My Academic Journey</h3>
      <p>My academic journey commenced with a Bachelor of Engineering in Project Management from Tsinghua University (2001-2005), followed by a PhD in Management Science and Engineering from the same university (2005-2010), specialising in equitable risk allocation for public-private partnership projects in China. I then progressed to a Research Fellow position at the National University of Singapore (2010-2013). Subsequently, I joined the University of Newcastle as a Lecturer in Construction Management (2013-2016). Since 2016, I have been with the University of Technology Sydney, initially as a Senior Lecturer in Project Management and, since January 2022, as an Associate Professor of Project Management.</p>
      <h3>Research Summary</h3>
      <p>My research focuses on the dynamics of infrastructure projects, primarily in the areas of project management and public-private partnerships within the Australian and Chinese contexts. My current research interests include ESG, social licence for infrastructure, social value, and value co-creation in projects. This work involves understanding public sentiment and engagement to ensure successful infrastructure developments and fostering relationships for mutual benefits. I have contributed to over 160 publications, which have cumulatively received more than 7,360 citations. My h-index is currently 35, and I was ranked among the top 2% of scientists in the single years of 2019 and 2022.</p>
      <h3>Teaching Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>I teach in the postgraduate Project Management program at the University of Technology Sydney. I champion practice-oriented and research-integrated learning, emphasising the use of team-based simulated projects to address real-world industry challenges. My teaching portfolio includes "Advances in Project Management", which enhances students' research awareness and capabilities; "Advanced Project Risk Management", focusing on specialised risk management across various industry sectors; "Project Risk, Procurement and Quality Management", which covers three fundamental project management knowledge areas; and "Managing Project Complexity", which explores the sources and management of complexity in projects through intensive workshops.</p>
      <h3>Professional Roles</h3>
      <p>In addition to my academic roles, I serve as the School Higher Degree Research Coordinator, an Editor for the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/pmx">Project Management Journal</a>, the Australian Editor for the <a href="https://www.inderscience.com/jhome.php?jcode=ijpom">International Journal of Project Organisation and Management</a>, and the Communications Coordinator of <a href="https://cibworld.org/commissions/w122-public-private-partnership/">CIB Working Commission W122 ‚Äê Public Private Partnership</a>. I am a Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.australiachinarelations.org/">Australia-China Relations Institute</a>. These roles are integral to my academic journey, enriching my research and extending its reach.</p>
