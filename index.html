            <h1>A/Prof Yongjian Ke @ UTS, Australia</h1>
            <aside>G'day! I'm Yongjian Ke, an Associate Professor at the University of Technology Sydney. I'm part of the vibrant community at the School of Built Environment, where I delve into Project Management. If you're curious about the pronunciation of my name, a handy audio guide is available below.</aside>

        <h2>My Academic Journey</h2>
            <p>I find myself at the intersection of engineering and society, unraveling the complexities of infrastructure projects. Much of my research has been a thrilling ride.  I find Public-Private Partnerships particularly fascinating, especially in the contexts of Australia and China. This interest leads me to explore areas like risk allocation, contracting behaviours, and social dynamics in projects.</p>
            <p>My current obsessions? Well, first there's the Social License for Infrastructure. This project is like stepping into a community's living room and asking, "How do you feel about that new highway or power plant?" Then, there's Value Co-Creation in infrastructure projects. It's not just about building things; it's about co-creating lasting value that benefits everyone from the construction company to the local fruit vendor.</p>
            <p>If we turn back the clock a bit, you'd find me digging deep into the cultural and contractual nuances that distinguish Australian and Chinese project teams. I also found a novel way to tap into community sentiment by analysing social media interactions around infrastructure projects.</p>
        <h2>Beyond Research Papers</h2>
            <p>I wear a few other hats alongside my primary role. I serve as an Editor for the Project Management Journal and as the Australian Editor for the International Journal of Project Organisation and Management. I am also a Research Associate at the Australia-China Relations Institute. Far from being sideline activities, these roles are integrated parts of my academic journey, enriching my research and extending its reach.</p>
        <h2>Fresh From My Desk</h2>
            <p>I'm particularly excited about our most recent publications, which add new layers of understanding to the fields they explore. These are 'Social Sustainability of Aged Care PPPs: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/sd.2654">Measurement and Current Status</a> | <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138644">Critical Practices and Realisation Paths</a>' and 'Social License for Infrastructure: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106453">Validation of Applicability</a> | <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.135966">Case Studies in China</a>'.</p>
        <h2>Academic Scoreboard</h2>
            <p>On the metrics side, I've contributed to over 140 publications that have cumulatively received more than 6,600 citations. For those who value the h-index, mine is currently at 34. I was ranked among the top 2% scientists in the single years of 2019 and 2022.</p>
        <h2>Within the Ivory Tower</h2>
            <p>I'm also deeply involved in teaching and supervision. My teaching philosophy leans towards a blend of practice-oriented and research-integrated methodologies. As a supervisor, I've had the pleasure of guiding PhD students to not just publish but also win awards for their exceptional work.</p>
        <h2>Reach Out</h2>
            <p>I'm currently working remotely but remain accessible. <a href="mailto:Yongjian.Ke@uts.edu.au">Email</a> is the most efficient way to reach me, and I'm also present on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yongjianke/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://profiles.uts.edu.au/yongjian.ke">UTS Profile</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=8hby4hcAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a> for more academic interactions.</p>
