      <h2>G'day</h2>
      <p>
        I am an Associate Professor in Project Management at the School of Built Environment, University of Technology Sydney, Australia.
        This is why the domain name is "<a href="https://pm-professor.com">pm-professor.com</a>".
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is pronounced "yong-jyen ker".
        In Chinese, it is written as 柯永建.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is not a record of credentials.
        My full CV, university profile and publication databases already do that.
        This site is for a short narrative about my work and thinking, and for research briefs that I will continue to add over time.
      </p>

      <h2>A position</h2>
      <p>
        I approach projects as temporary governance arrangements rather than neutral delivery tasks. 
        Even when projects are technically competent and economically justified, their outcomes depend on how authority, responsibility, and accountability are structured, and how these arrangements respond to social expectations over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contemporary infrastructure and public service contexts, project success is judged not only by delivery performance but also by fairness, accountability, and long-term public value. 
        When projects struggle under these conditions, the causes are rarely technical alone. 
        They are often institutional and social, shaped by governance choices such as contracts, risk allocation, performance measures, and engagement practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        This way of thinking guides how I study infrastructure and public service projects, and how I engage with practitioners, policy actors, and researchers.
      </p>

      <h2>How this position shapes my work</h2>
      <p>
        Starting from this position, my work concentrates on settings where governance choices are visible, contested, and difficult to reverse. 
        Infrastructure and public service projects provide such settings. 
        They involve long time horizons, multiple actors, and public scrutiny, which makes questions of responsibility, legitimacy, and trust unavoidable.
      </p>
      <p>
        One stream of my work examines public private partnerships and related contracting models. 
        I study how risk allocation, performance criteria, and contractual flexibility shape behaviour across the project life cycle. 
        Rather than treating contracts as technical instruments, I analyse them as governance devices that influence cooperation, opportunism, and adaptation under uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another strand of my work focuses on legitimacy, social licence, and public acceptance in infrastructure projects. 
        I treat acceptance not as a fixed attitude or a one-off consultation outcome, but as an evolving condition shaped by how decisions are made, communicated, and experienced. 
        This helps explain why projects that meet technical and regulatory requirements can still face persistent resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        A further strand engages with digitalisation and artificial intelligence in project settings. 
        Rather than assuming technological improvement, I examine how project-level readiness and institutional conditions shape what data-driven tools can and cannot achieve in temporary and complex project organisations.
      </p>

      <h2>What I am known for, and why it matters</h2>
      <p>
        My most-cited work sits in public private partnership research, with a clear focus on risk allocation and risk assessment in China. 
        This body of research helped make risk allocation a practical governance question rather than a contractual formality. 
        It matters because allocation choices shape incentives, behaviour, and accountability across the full life of an asset.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also known for work that explains why PPPs succeed or stall under real institutional conditions. 
        This includes success factors, obstacles, adoption drivers, and sector-specific risk profiles. 
        The underlying argument is that PPP performance depends on how public and private actors interpret responsibility, manage uncertainty, and respond to political and community pressures, not only on financial feasibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        More recently, my work has contributed to how social licence and public acceptance are understood in contentious infrastructure settings. 
        It clarifies why social licence and public acceptance are related but not identical, social licence captures the ongoing and conditional nature of community consent, including its vulnerability to sudden shifts. 
        The practical message is that legitimacy can be strengthened when proponents, regulators, and communities co-produce fair processes, transparent information, and visible local benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        A further contribution is organising what the field knows through trend analysis and review work. 
        This matters because fast-growing research areas can become fragmented, and synthesis work helps the field see patterns, blind spots, and priorities for future study.
      </p>

      <h2>Research briefs</h2>
      <p>
        I use research briefs to develop ideas in a more direct and accessible way.
        They are not summaries of journal papers.
        Each brief focuses on a core problem, clarifies how I think about it, and draws out implications for practice and policy.
        This section will continue to grow as new briefs are added.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/briefs/1.html">Social licence and public acceptance in infrastructure projects</a><br />
          Why technically approved projects still face resistance, how social licence differs from public acceptance, and what this means for governing contentious infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/briefs/2.html">Advancing social sustainability in aged care</a><br />
          How social sustainability can be understood, assessed, and strengthened in aged care systems, with attention to access, workforce conditions, and lived experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/briefs/3.html">Risk allocation and management in public private partnerships</a><br />
          Why risk allocation is a governance choice that shapes behaviour, incentives, and long-term outcomes, rather than a contractual afterthought.
